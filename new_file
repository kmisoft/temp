Most financial series can
be made stationary with
a fractional
differentiation of order
𝑑 < 0.5.
However, most financial
studies are based on
returns, where 𝑑 = 1.
The implication is that
for decades most
financial research has
been based on overdifferentiated (memoryless) series, leading to
spurious forecasts and
overfitting.
